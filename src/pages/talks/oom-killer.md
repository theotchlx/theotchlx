## The project

Talk/démo de 15 minutes sur le OutOfMemory Killer du kernel Linux. (talk libre, Polycloud 2024, à Polytech Montpellier).

code:

```c
a
```
As you can see, I take up much more memory than I have. (??)

The OOM Killer's last resort is to end the process that is eating up all that memory.
But first, it tries to rearrange memory as well as possible

Was packed with fun.
Audience was great.
Great audience.
