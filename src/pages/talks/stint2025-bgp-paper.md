## Why do this talk?

During my summer internship at D3TN GmbH ([related blog article here](/blog/articles/a-dtn-summer-internship)), we wrote a paper entilted "A Border Gateway Protocol Extension for Distributing Endpoint Identifier Reachability Information in Delay-tolerant Networks". This was my first paper, and I was very excited to be given the opportunity to present our work at STINT.

## Paper presentation

I'll add the slides (and possibly recorded talk) here, as well as a commentary on the talk when I find the time :-)

Until then, thanks for reading! In the meantime, you can find the STINT talks on Juan Fraire's YouTube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@juanfraire>
