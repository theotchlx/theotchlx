## The project

**Beep** is a social media platform / messaging web application that can handle dozens of concurrent video/audio streams, as well as instant messaging, files, and has tons of features!

We're a team of 15 DevOps apprentice working on the project all year round.

## Why Beep?

This is a class project we have been building for almost a year now, and we will continue to build on it for the next two years, as part of our studies.

In the class I'm in, we call this project the "Ariane's thread" project. This is the project we'll be working on for the next three years until we graduate.

Our teachers supervising the project act as our clients.  
They request features under a deadline, and it's up to us to allocate our resources and manage our time to quantify and complete our workload to reach our milestones in the given time.

Their requested features have been crafted to direct us to face specific technical and organisational challenges. This allowed us to develop a hands-on experience in team and project management, as well as face technical challenges and understand core principles of the DevOps methodology, clean code, open source, refactoring and much more.

## How?

This part is coming soon...!

### Project and team management

Management isn't for everybody. This project made us realize how hard it can be. Luckily, I find this subject and the challenges around it extremely interesting!
Beep led me to read a lot on the subject, and taught me skills I wouldn't have had the chance to develop any other way.

### Challenges

There were a lot of challenges around Beep. management, video/audio stream handling et webrtc, organisation, agile (Ã©quipes de plus de 6), ...
