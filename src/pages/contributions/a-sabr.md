## The project

A-SABR is "The Adaptive Library for Schedule-Aware Bundle Routing".
It is a Rust library that offers tons of bundle routing capabilities, as well as Python bindings for Python programs.

Olivier De Jonckère, a DTN expert, professor at the University of Montpellier where I study, is currently the sole developer and maintainer of A-SABR.

A-SABR leverages complex Rust primitives for maximum flexibility and performance.
It has follows a very modular design that makes understanding the codebase, and contributing easier.

## Contributions

I'm currently involved in A-SABR by helping in cleaning the codebase, refactoring here and there.
This gives me a better understanding of such bundle routing libraries, as well as allows me to lend a helping hand to a professor to whom I'm very grateful.

As a side note, I also helped design and review the STINT 2025 hackathon exercises on A-SABR, I also initialized their structure based on my similar personal experiences at other events.
