## The project

**[Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/)** is a lightweight library that provides a set of widgets and utilities to build complex TUIs (Terminal User Interfaces) in Rust.

## My contributions

I am currently working on adding dotted borders into Ratatui. This would be a new feature, but quite easy.  
Ratatui's community is great, and it has been a very good experience working with them so far. I plan on doing more work for Ratatui in the future.
