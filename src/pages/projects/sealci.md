## The project

**Sealci** is a distributed CI system written in Rust.  
It is made of four microservices withcommon interface definitions using protobuff and OpenApi specifications. The interfaces are implemented using Tonic and gRPC following the API-driven development principle.

We were fifteen DevOps student engineers working on the projects, divided in groups to distribute the efforts of designing and implementing each service together with the rest of the team.  
The APIs being defined properly, we were able to work in parallel

I worked on the scheduler design and implementation alone, and helped review the other microservices' design and implementation with an open source philosophy in mind.

This is a class project we have been building for almost a year now, and we will continue to build on it for the next two years, as part of our studies.

## Project and team management

Management isn't for everybody. This project made us realize how hard it can be. Luckily, I find this subject and the challenges around it extremely interesting!
Beep led me to read a lot on the subject, and taught me skills I wouldn't have had the chance to develop any other way.

## Challenges

There were a lot of challenges around Beep. management, video/audio stream handling et webrtc, organisation, agile (Ã©quipes de plus de 6), ...
