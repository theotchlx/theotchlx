### Hi there, this is my account on GitHub

You can reach me by email for any enquiries, or simply to chat: mailto:theo.tchlx@gmail.com, though don't expect an instantaneous answer from this address.

# Give Up GitHub

I have given up GitHub for hosting my personal projects. ([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).)

Any use of my projects' code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of my projects' code in Copilot.

You can [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) too.
